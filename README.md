Hi, I’m Nowell. I graduated from Oxford with a MMath in Mathematics in July 2021. My research experience includes looking at:
- A coevolutionary hypergraph model for opinion dynamics
- Seperating dyadic and higher-order influence on adoption of a microfinance scheme in social networks of Indian Villages
- Methods of constructing spatial networks 

I'm interested in networks and hypergraphs and their applications. You can contact me at nowell.phelps@gmail.com, or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nowell_phelps">@nowell_phelps<a>.
Feel free to reach out with interesting projects!
