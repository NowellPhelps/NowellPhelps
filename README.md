Hi, I’m Nowell. I'm currently working as a Research Assistant in Epidemiology and Population Health at Imperial College London for <a href="https://ncdrisc.org/">NCD-RisC<a>, working on modelling global trends in risk factors of non-communicable diseases. I graduated from Oxford with a MMath in Mathematics in July 2021, and my past research experience includes:
- Investigating a coevolutionary hypergraph opinion dynamics model for political polarisation
- Constructing spatial networks from household location data to investigate the spatial distribution of treatement for schistosomiasis
- Attempting to separate dyadic and higher-order influence on adoption of a microfinance in rural Indian Villages


I'm broadly in epidemiology, data, networks and complexity. You can contact me at nowell.phelps@gmail.com, or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nowell_phelps">@PhelpsNowell<a>.
